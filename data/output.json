5. Testing
Tests use pytest.
From the project root:
bashpytest

The test suite validates:

HTML parsing into lead items (spiders.parser).

Cleaning, validation, and unique_key generation (pipelines.cleaner).

6. Extending the Tool
To adapt the project for a new target:

Add or adjust start URLs in your configuration file.

Extend or replace parsing logic in src/spiders/parser.py.

Optionally add new spiders under src/spiders/ for specific platforms.

Keep the item schema stable so pipelines and exports continue to work without changes.
